# terransible_test1

This is my first set of successful terraform plans and ansible playbooks to create a server, upgrade and provision that server, and populate it with a sample website from my repo.

I'll continue to build on this to get it to build further infrastructure.

Still to be done:

- Route53 dns changes once the site is deployed.
- DB server
- Proof of db connectivity
- Process for site re-deploy once it's built and set up the first time.
